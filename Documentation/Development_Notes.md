# Development Notes for JamesCRM

## Frontend Development

### Tailwind CSS Usage

The current prototype uses Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid development:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

**Note**: This approach is not recommended for production. When moving to production, you should:

1. Install Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin:
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

2. Configure your `tailwind.config.js` file
3. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS
4. Run the build process

For more information, see the [Tailwind CSS Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### JavaScript Implementation

The current prototype uses vanilla JavaScript for simplicity. In a production environment, consider:

1. Using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular
2. Implementing proper state management
3. Setting up a build process with Webpack or Vite

## Backend Integration

The current prototype includes mock API functionality to demonstrate features without requiring a backend connection. In production:

1. Remove the mock API code
2. Connect to the real backend API endpoints
3. Implement proper error handling and loading states
4. Add authentication token refresh logic

## User Management

The user management system currently uses localStorage for demo purposes. In production:

1. Implement proper JWT authentication
2. Add token expiration and refresh logic
3. Implement role-based access control
4. Add email verification for new users

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Setup a proper build system**:
   - Use a bundler like Webpack or Vite
   - Configure minification and optimization

2. **Replace Tailwind CDN**:
   - Install Tailwind as a dependency
   - Configure PostCSS

3. **Improve Authentication**:
   - Implement proper JWT handling
   - Add refresh token logic

4. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Add global error boundaries
   - Implement retry logic for API calls

5. **Add Testing**:
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for user flows
   - End-to-end tests for critical paths
