JamesCRM Video Call Integration Plan
Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding video call functionality to JamesCRM. The goal is to provide a cost-effective, reliable solution that allows users to initiate video calls with contacts directly from the CRM interface.

Current State
JamesCRM currently has placeholder UI elements for video calling functionality:

Call buttons in contact detail pages
Video call options in quick actions
Activity scheduling for calls in the Activities tab
Target Solution
We will implement a WebRTC-based video calling solution with minimal infrastructure costs, focusing on one-to-one calls between CRM users and contacts.

Fallback Strategy
If WebRTC implementation proves challenging or unreliable, we will consider these alternatives:

Daily.co Integration
Use free tier (2,000 minutes/month)
Simple iframe integration
Minimal backend changes required
Jitsi Meet Embedding
Embed Jitsi Meet in an iframe
Use public Jitsi servers initially
Option to self-host later if needed
Monitoring Plan
We will monitor the following metrics to ensure quality and reliability:

Technical Metrics
Connection success rate
Average call duration
Error frequency by type
Browser/device distribution
Business Metrics
Calls per user/contact
Feature adoption rate
Call outcomes (tracked via post-call notes)
User satisfaction (via feedback)
Resource Requirements
Development Resources

The implementation will be considered successful when:

Users can initiate and receive video calls directly from the CRM
Call quality is reliable across different network conditions
Call history is properly recorded and accessible
The solution maintains low operational costs
User adoption reaches at least 50% within 3 months of launch
Next Steps
Finalize technical approach and resource allocation
Begin Phase 1 implementation

Agent can take notes, schedule follow-ups during call
Either party can end call
Agent completes post-call wrap-up (notes, outcome, follow-ups)
Call record added to contact history
Incoming Call Handling
Agent receives notification of incoming call
Notification displays caller information
Agent can accept or decline call
Upon acceptance, video/audio connection established
Contact information displayed in sidebar
