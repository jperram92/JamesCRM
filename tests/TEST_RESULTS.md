### Recent Improvements

We've made significant improvements to the test suite:

1. **Fixed Auth Controller Tests**: Updated to properly handle validation errors and mock dependencies correctly.

2. **Fixed Company Controller Tests**: Improved error handling and database operation mocking.

3. **Fixed User Controller Tests**: Enhanced authentication and database operation handling.

4. **Fixed WebRTC Service Tests**: Improved socket.io operation mocking.

5. **Enhanced Model Tests**:
   - Created a mock Sequelize setup for testing models
   - Fixed User model tests to handle validation correctly
   - Updated Company model with required fields

6. **Fixed Integration Tests**:
   - Updated auth tests to handle validation errors correctly
   - Fixed company tests to handle date formatting differences

The testing approach follows best practices for isolation, mocking, naming, assertions, coverage, maintainability, speed, and reliability. The tests are integrated with GitHub Actions to run automatically on pull requests and pushes to the main branch, ensuring that all code changes are tested before they are merged.

This level of test coverage provides confidence in the reliability and correctness of the JamesCRM application.
